Plotted results comparing the performance of several approaches to road classification in satellite imagery. Classifiers were used to predict whether a given pixel was road or not. Note: only results for the road models are shown

Compared Models:
> CART <br /> Random Forest <br /> Logistic Regression <br /> XGBoost
